# mactype-infinality
Unmerged Infinality feature patch for Freetype that attempts to compile and work with MacType

This should cleanly patch Freetype 2.8, and provide a dll and source files that will compile properly for MacType.  Currently the resulting MacType build crashes for me.

This patch is based of the existing maintainers of the patch:
